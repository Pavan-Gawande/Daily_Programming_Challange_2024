THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS ALL CODES THAT I HAVE DONE IN DAILY PROGRAMMING CHALLANGE 2024

DAY 01 : SORT AN ARRAY OF 0S, 1S, AND 2S IN INCREASING ORDER IN LINEAR TIME (I.E., O(N)) WITHOUT USING ANY EXTRA SPACE.

DAY 02 : GIVEN THE LIST OF INTEGERS FROM RANGE 1 TO N WITH ONE MISSING NUMBER. FIND THAT MISSING NUMBER.

DAY 03 : GIVEN AN ARRAY ARR CONTAINING N+1 INTEGERS, WHERE EACH INTEGER IS IN THE RANGE [1, N] INCLUSIVE.THERE IS ONE DUPLICATE NUMBER FIND THAT NUMBER. 

DAY 04 : GIVEN TWO SORTED ARRAYS AND WE NEED TO MERGE THEM IN PLACE (WITHOUT USING EXTRA SPACE) SO THAT BOTH ARRAYS REMAIN SORTED.
