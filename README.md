# Daily_Programming_Challange_2024
THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS ALL CODES THAT I HAVE DONE IN DAILY PROGRAMMING CHALLANGE 2024

DAY 01 : SORT AN ARRAY OF 0S, 1S, AND 2S IN INCREASING ORDER IN LINEAR TIME (I.E., O(N)) WITHOUT USING ANY EXTRA SPACE.

DAY 02 : GIVEN THE LIST OF INTEGERS FROM RANGE 1 TO N WITH ONE MISSING NUMBER. FIND THAT MISSING NUMBER.

DAY 03 : GIVEN AN ARRAY ARR CONTAINING N+1 INTEGERS, WHERE EACH INTEGER IS IN THE RANGE [1, N] INCLUSIVE.THERE IS ONE DUPLICATE NUMBER FIND THAT NUMBER. 

DAY 04 : GIVEN TWO SORTED ARRAYS AND WE NEED TO MERGE THEM IN PLACE (WITHOUT USING EXTRA SPACE) SO THAT BOTH ARRAYS REMAIN SORTED.

DAY 05 : GIVEN AN INTEGER ARRAY ARR OF SIZE N. FIND ALL THE LEADERS IN GIVEN ARRAY. AN ELEMENT IS CONSIDERED A LEADER IF IT IS GREATER THAN ALL THE ELEMENTS TO ITS RIGHT.

DAY 06 : GIVEN AN INTEGER ARRAY ARR OF SIZE N. WE NEED TO FIND ALL THE SUBARRAYS WHOSE ELEMENTS SUM IS ZERO. RETURN LIST OF TUPLES CONTAINING STARTING AND ENDING INDEXES OF SUBARRAYS.

DAY 07 : GIVEN AN ARRAY OF NON-NEGATIVE INTEGERS, WHERE EACH NUMBER REPRESENTS THE HEIGHT OF A BAR IN A HISTOGRAM-LIKE STRUCTURE. WATER CAN COLLECT BETWEEN THE BARS WHEN THERE ARE TALLER BARS ON BOTH SIDES OF SHORTER BARS. FIND HOW MUCH WATER CAN BE TRAPPED BETWEEN THESE BARS.

DAY 08 : GIVEN AN INPUT-STRING S THAT CONSISTS OF MULTIPLE WORDS SEPARATED BY SPACES. RETURN AN OUTPUT-STRING THAT CONTAINS THE REVERSE ORDER OF THE WORDS IN THE INPUT-STRING.

DAY 09 : GIVEN AN ARRAY OF STRINGS STRS[], CONSISTING OF LOWERCASE LETTERS. FIND THE LONGEST COMMON PREFIX SHARED AMONG ALL THE STRINGS.

DAY 10 : GIVEN AN ARRAY OF STRINGS STRS[]. GROUP ALL THE STRINGS THAT ARE ANAGRAMS OF EACH OTHER. AN ANAGRAM IS A WORD OR PHRASE FORMED BY REARRANGING THE LETTERS OF A DIFFERENT WORD OR PHRASE, TYPICALLY USING ALL THE ORIGINAL LETTERS EXACTLY ONCE.

DAY 11: GIVEN AN INPUT_STRING. WE NEED TO GENERATE AND RETURN ALL POSSIBLE PERMUTATIONS OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE STRING.
