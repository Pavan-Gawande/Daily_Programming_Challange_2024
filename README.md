# Daily_Programming_Challange_2024
THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS ALL CODES THAT I HAVE DONE IN DAILY PROGRAMMING CHALLANGE 2024

DAY 01 : SORT AN ARRAY OF 0S, 1S, AND 2S IN INCREASING ORDER IN LINEAR TIME (I.E., O(N)) WITHOUT USING ANY EXTRA SPACE.

DAY 02 : GIVEN THE LIST OF INTEGERS FROM RANGE 1 TO N WITH ONE MISSING NUMBER. FIND THAT MISSING NUMBER.

DAY 03 : GIVEN AN ARRAY ARR CONTAINING N+1 INTEGERS, WHERE EACH INTEGER IS IN THE RANGE [1, N] INCLUSIVE.THERE IS ONE DUPLICATE NUMBER FIND THAT NUMBER. 

DAY 04 : GIVEN TWO SORTED ARRAYS AND WE NEED TO MERGE THEM IN PLACE (WITHOUT USING EXTRA SPACE) SO THAT BOTH ARRAYS REMAIN SORTED.

DAY 05 : GIVEN AN INTEGER ARRAY ARR OF SIZE N. FIND ALL THE LEADERS IN GIVEN ARRAY. AN ELEMENT IS CONSIDERED A LEADER IF IT IS GREATER THAN ALL THE ELEMENTS TO ITS RIGHT.

DAY 06 : GIVEN AN INTEGER ARRAY ARR OF SIZE N. WE NEED TO FIND ALL THE SUBARRAYS WHOSE ELEMENTS SUM IS ZERO. RETURN LIST OF TUPLES CONTAINING STARTING AND ENDING INDEXES OF SUBARRAYS.

DAY 07 : GIVEN AN ARRAY OF NON-NEGATIVE INTEGERS, WHERE EACH NUMBER REPRESENTS THE HEIGHT OF A BAR IN A HISTOGRAM-LIKE STRUCTURE. WATER CAN COLLECT BETWEEN THE BARS WHEN THERE ARE TALLER BARS ON BOTH SIDES OF SHORTER BARS. FIND HOW MUCH WATER CAN BE TRAPPED BETWEEN THESE BARS.

DAY 08 : GIVEN AN INPUT-STRING S THAT CONSISTS OF MULTIPLE WORDS SEPARATED BY SPACES. RETURN AN OUTPUT-STRING THAT CONTAINS THE REVERSE ORDER OF THE WORDS IN THE INPUT-STRING.

DAY 09 : GIVEN AN ARRAY OF STRINGS STRS[], CONSISTING OF LOWERCASE LETTERS. FIND THE LONGEST COMMON PREFIX SHARED AMONG ALL THE STRINGS.

DAY 10 : GIVEN AN ARRAY OF STRINGS STRS[]. GROUP ALL THE STRINGS THAT ARE ANAGRAMS OF EACH OTHER. AN ANAGRAM IS A WORD OR PHRASE FORMED BY REARRANGING THE LETTERS OF A DIFFERENT WORD OR PHRASE, TYPICALLY USING ALL THE ORIGINAL LETTERS EXACTLY ONCE.

DAY 11: GIVEN AN INPUT_STRING. WE NEED TO GENERATE AND RETURN ALL POSSIBLE PERMUTATIONS OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE STRING.

DAY 12 : GIVEN AN INPUT_STRING CONSISTING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARENTHESES: (), {}, AND []. DETERMINE WHETHER THE GIVEN STRING IS VALID OR NOT.

DAY 13 : GIVEN AN INPUT_STRING . FIND AND RETURN THE LONGEST PALINDROMIC SUBSTRING WITHIN THE GIVEN STRING. A PALINDROME IS A STRING THAT READS THE SAME FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS.

DAY 14 : GIVEN AN INPUT_STRING OF LOWERCASE ENGLISH ALPHABETS AND AN INTEGER K. WE NEED TO COUNT ALL POSSIBLE SUBSTRINGS OF INPUT_STRING THAT CONTAIN EXACTLY K DISTINCT CHARACTERS.

DAY 15 : GIVEN AN INPUT_STRING, AND WE NEED TO FIND THE LENGTH OF THE LONGEST SUBSTRING THAT CONTAINS NO REPEATING CHARACTERS.

DAY 16 : GIVEN TWO INTEGERS, A AND B. WE NEED TO FIND THE LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE (LCM) OF THESE TWO NUMBERS.

DAY 17 : GIVEN A POSITIVE INTEGER N, WE NEED TO FIND ITS PRIME FACTORIZATION. RETURN A LIST OF PRIME NUMBERS THAT MULTIPLY TOGETHER TO GIVE N. IF N IS PRIME, THE OUTPUT SHOULD BE A LIST CONTAINING ONLY N.

DAY 18 : GIVEN A POSITIVE INTEGER N, WE NEED TO FIND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DIVISORS (FACTORS) OF N. A DIVISOR OF N IS ANY INTEGER THAT DIVIDES N WITHOUT LEAVING A REMAINDER.

DAY 19 : GIVEN A POSTFIX EXPRESSION (ALSO KNOWN AS REVERSE POLISH NOTATION), WE NEED TO EVALUATE THE EXPRESSION AND RETURN THE RESULT. THE EXPRESSION CAN CONTAIN INTEGERS AND THE ARITHMETIC OPERATORS +, -, *, / AND ^(XOR). ASSUME THAT THE INPUT IS ALWAYS VALID AND THE DIVISION OPERATOR PERFORMS INTEGER DIVISION, TRUNCATING TOWARDS ZERO.

DAY 20 : GIVEN A STACK OF INTEGERS, WE NEED TO WRITE A FUNCTION THAT SORTS THE STACK IN ASCENDING ORDER. WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY ADDITIONAL DATA STRUCTURE LIKE ARRAYS, LISTS, OR ANOTHER STACK. THE ONLY OPERATIONS YOU ARE ALLOWED TO PERFORM ARE PUSH, POP, AND PEEK ON THE STACK. THE SORTING MUST BE PERFORMED USING RECURSION ONLY.

DAY 21 : GIVEN A STACK OF INTEGERS, AND WE NEED TO WRITE A FUNCTION THAT REVERSES THE STACK USING RECURSION. WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY ADDITIONAL DATA STRUCTURE (LIKE ARRAYS, LISTS, OR ANOTHER STACK). THE ONLY OPERATIONS WE ARE ALLOWED TO PERFORM ARE PUSH, POP, AND PEEK ON THE STACK. THE REVERSAL MUST BE DONE USING RECURSION ONLY.

DAY 22 : GIVEN AN ARRAY OF INTEGERS AND AN INTEGER K. WE NEED TO FIND THE FIRST ELEMENT IN THE ARRAY THAT APPEARS EXACTLY K TIMES. IF NO SUCH ELEMENT EXISTS, RETURN -1.

DAY 23 : GIVEN AN ARRAY OF INTEGERS ARR AND A POSITIVE INTEGER K. WE NEED TO FIND THE MAXIMUM ELEMENT IN EACH SLIDING WINDOW OF SIZE K. THE WINDOW SLIDES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, ONE ELEMENT AT A TIME, AND WE NEED TO RETURN THE MAXIMUM ELEMENT FOR EACH OF THESE WINDOWS.

DAY 24 : GIVEN A BINARY TREE AND TWO DISTINCT NODES WITHIN THE TREE. WE NEED TO FIND THE LOWEST COMMON ANCESTOR (LCA) OF THESE TWO NODES. THE LCA OF TWO NODES P AND Q IS DEFINED AS THE LOWEST NODE IN THE TREE THAT HAS BOTH P AND Q AS DESCENDANTS (WHERE WE ALLOW A NODE TO BE A DESCENDANT OF ITSELF).

DAY 25 : GIVEN THE ROOT OF A BINARY TREE. WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TREE IS A VALID BINARY SEARCH TREE (BST)

DAY 26 : GIVEN AN UNDIRECTED GRAPH REPRESENTED BY AN ADJACENCY LIST. WE NEED TO DETERMINE IF THE GRAPH CONTAINS ANY CYCLE. A CYCLE IS FORMED IF WE CAN TRAVERSE THROUGH A SEQUENCE OF EDGES THAT STARTS AND ENDS AT THE SAME VERTEX

DAY 27 : GIVEN AN UNWEIGHTED GRAPH REPRESENTED BY AN ADJACENCY LIST. WE NEED TO FIND THE SHORTEST PATH (IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF EDGES) BETWEEN TWO GIVEN NODES IN THE GRAPH.

DAY 28 : GIVEN AN ARRAY OF NODES OF A BINARY TREE. WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TREE IS SYMMETRIC. A BINARY TREE IS SYMMETRIC IF THE LEFT AND RIGHT SUBTREES ARE MIRROR IMAGES OF EACH OTHER.

DAY 29 : GIVEN AN INTEGER N. WE NEED TO CALCULATE THE N-TH FIBONACCI NUMBER USING DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING. LIKE FOR N=0 O/P WILL BE 0. AND FOR N=1 O/P WILL BE 1, AND SO ON.
